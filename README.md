# YOLOv8-based Traffic Object Detection â€“ Intelligent Computer Vision for Smart Cities

## Project Introduction

This project utilizes **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8)** â€“ one of the most advanced real-time object detection models developed by **Ultralytics** â€“ to build a **computer vision system** capable of detecting and classifying multiple traffic-related objects in urban environments.

The model is optimized to recognize **nine (9) essential classes**, including:
- Motorbike  
- Car  
- Truck  
- Bus  
- License Plate  
- Person  
- Helmeted Person  
- Non-Helmeted Person  
- Traffic Light (Red, Yellow, Green)

The purpose of this project is to contribute to the development of **smart transportation infrastructure** through AI-driven insights and real-time monitoring.

## Real-World Applications

Our traffic object detection solution is highly applicable in:

- **Traffic surveillance systems** in urban areas
- **Helmet compliance monitoring** for motorcyclists
- **Red-light violation detection**
- **Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR)**
- **People and vehicle counting**
- **Smart traffic lights and congestion control**
- **Urban planning and traffic flow analysis**

These applications are valuable for **government agencies**, **smart city initiatives**, **transportation authorities**, **logistics companies**, and **traffic camera solution providers**.
